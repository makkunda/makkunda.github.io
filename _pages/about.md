I am a master's student in Advanced Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>.
Before this, I was a research fellow at <a href="https://www.wadhwaniai.org/">Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>, with <a href="https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/">Makarand Tapaswi</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jigarkdoshi/">Jigar Doshi</a> and <a href="https://www.wadhwaniai.org/team/jerome-white/">Jerome White</a>, where we worked on developing AI based solutions for social impact. There, I worked on a project for screening for tubercolosis using cough sounds. I also worked on the <a href="https://www.wadhwaniai.org/programs/pest-management/">pest management solution</a> where we built an early pest detection system for cotton farmers . Before this, I worked on a <a href="https://www.wadhwaniai.org/programs/cough-against-covid/">covid diagnosis from cough sounds</a> project. 
Previously, I was at IIT Delhi, where I received a dual degree in Computer Science . There I was fortunate to work with <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~suban/">Subhashis Banerjee</a> and <a href="https://web.iitd.ac.in/~sbpaul/">Saurabh Paul</a> on using satellite images to predict the Indian census . During that time, I also spent a summer at Adobe Research with <a href="https://research.adobe.com/person/vishwa-vinay/">Vishwa Vinay</a>.
